# War Detection

## Information
The bot analyzes data obtained from opensky-network.org in Eastern bloc countries (due to the conflict in Ukraine and the potential risk of war elsewhere). An analysis is carried out on the basis of the obtained data.

We focus on private planes to catch the planes of the richest residents. When a certain number of inhabitants leave their country and go to safer countries, it is a signal to us about a potential threat.

Then a message is created on Twitter about the threat. Example:
